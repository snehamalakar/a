                    Has a frozen heart worth mining<br>
                    So cut through the heart, cold and clear<br>

                    For years I've roamed these empty halls<br>
                    Why have a ballroom with no balls?<br>
                    Finally they're opening up the gates<br>
                    There'll be actual real live people<br>
                    It'll be totally strange<br>
                    But wow, am I so ready for this change<br>
                    'Cause for the first time in forever<br>
                    There'll be music, there'll be light<br>
                    For the first time in forever<br>

                    Don't know if I'm elated or gassy<br>

                    What if I meet... the one?<br>
                    Tonight imagine me gown and all<br>
                    Fetchingly draped against the wall<br>
                    The picture of sophisticated grace<br>

                    A beautiful stranger, tall and fair<br>
                    I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face<br>
                    But then we laugh and talk all evening,<br>

                    For the first time in forever<br>
                    I could be noticed by someone<br>
                    And I know it is totally crazy<br>
                    To dream I'd find romance<br>
                    But for the first time in forever<br>

                    I'll finally see a summer breeze, blow away a winter storm<br>
                    And find out what happens to solid water when it gets warm!<br>
                    And I can't wait to see, what my buddies all think of mev
                    Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summerrrrrr<br>
                    Da da, da doo, ah bah bah bah bah bah boo<br>
                    The hot and the cold are both so intense<br>
                    Put'em together - it just makes sense!<br>
                    Ratdadat dad dada doo<br>
                    Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle<br>
                    But put me in summer and I'll be a - happy snowman!<br>
                    When life gets rough, I like to hold on to my dream<br>
                    Relaxing in the summer sun, just lettin' off steam<br>
                    Oh the sky would be blue, and you guys'll be there too<br>
                    When I finally do what frozen things do in summerrrrrrr<br>
                    Kristoff: I'm gonna' tell him -<br>
